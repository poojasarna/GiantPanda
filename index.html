    <p>
        The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear or
        simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China.

    </p>

    <p>
        It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.

    </p>


    <p>
        The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up
        more than 99% of its diet.
    </p>

    <p>
        In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially
        prepared food.

    </p>


    <p>
        Giant pandas <strong>in the wild</strong> will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the
        form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
